### Description of Data Visualization: Looking at the two-way frequency table for Army Enlisted personnel, it’s clear that there are far more males than females across all pay grades. The difference becomes especially obvious in the higher ranks (E6–E9), where very few females are represented. This suggests that sex and rank aren’t independent in this group, since the distribution of ranks is heavily weighted toward males.

# Step 1: Read Data 
armed_raw <- read.csv("US_Armed_Force_Data.csv")

# Step 2: Clean names for consistency 
armed_clean <- armed_raw 
  clean_names()

# Step 3: Reshape from wide to long format 
armed_long <- armed_clean
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -pay_grade,
    names_to = c("branch", "sex"),
    names_sep = "\\."
  ) 
  mutate(
    count = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", value)),  # remove commas and convert to numeric
    branch = str_replace_all(branch, "_", " "),
    sex = str_to_title(sex)
  ) %>%
  select(pay_grade, branch, sex, count)

# Step 4: Filter to a valid subgroup 
army_enlisted <- armed_long 
  filter(branch == "Army", str_detect(pay_grade, "^E"))

# Step 5: Create a two-way frequency table 
freq_table <- army_enlisted 
  group_by(pay_grade, sex) 
  summarise(total = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = total, values_fill = 0)
  # Filter data for Army Enlisted only
  
  # Step 6: Two Way Frequency Table
  army_enlisted <- combined_armed_data %>%
    filter(branch_name == "Army", rank_name %in% c("Private", "Corporal", "Sergeant"))
  
  freq_table <- table(army_enlisted$sex, army_enlisted$rank_name)

  
# Step 7: View results 
print(freq_table)
