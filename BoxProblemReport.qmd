# Plotting a Mathematical Function: Box Problem

### Starting with a rectangular piece of paper, we can create an open-top box by cutting out equal squares from each of the four corners and folding up the sides. The size of the cut-out squares determines the dimensions and volume of the resulting box. We can explore how the volume changes with different square side lengths by plotting the volume as a function of the cut-out size.

## Running Code
volumeOfBox <- function(x){
  #In the problem description, we are asked to assume that we have a standard           #sheet of letter paper: 36 inches by 48 inches.

  volume = 0
  LENGTH = 36
  WIDTH = 48     
  
  volume <- x*(LENGTH-2*x)*(WIDTH-2*x)
  
  if(runif(volume)<0){
    return("Value of Side Length(x) is too large.")
  }
  
  return(volume)
  
}
